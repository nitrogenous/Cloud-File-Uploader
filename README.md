XUP-File-Uploader

Don't judge me with credentials and vendor folder. It was my first GitHub project and I wasn't know .gitignore.

You can store your form users' files directly your Drive, Dropbox and AWS with XUP File
Uploader. XUP File Uploader is serverless and secure. You don't have to worry about your files
with XUP because your files are only stored to your own storages.
